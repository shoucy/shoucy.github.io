# [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

It’s my birthday. I’m 68. I feel like pulling up a rocking chair and dispensing advice to the young ‘uns. Here are 68 pithy bits of unsolicited advice which I offer as my birthday present to all of you.(For my 69th birthday I made [another batch](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).)

*今天是我的生日，我68了。我打算拉来一把摇椅，给年轻人一些建议。这里是我给予的68条简洁明了的忠告，作为我在我生日时对每一位你的礼物。（在我69岁生日时，我又写了一些[别的建议](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)。）*

1. Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.
   
   *学会从那些你不认同甚至冒犯过你的人身上学习。看是否可以从他们所相信的事物中寻得真相。*

2. Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
   
   *保持热情抵得上25点IQ。*
   ::: tip
   人们的智商是以平均数字100和标准差15为正态分布的。2005年，林恩教授公布了一项“大胆”的研究成果，称“男性比女性的智商高5点”。随后，林恩还对世界各国大学生的平均智商进行了比较，结果发现，美国大学生智商为110，居全球之首，而英国大学生紧随其后，平均智商109。

3. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
   
   *总是定一个deadline。deadline可以淘汰那些多余与平庸的事情。它防止你尝试做到完美，这样你就会将事情做地有所不同。有所不同是件好事。*

4. Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
   
   *不要害怕问出一个听起来愚蠢的问题，因为99%的时候每个人其实都想问相同的问题却因为害怕尴尬而没问。*

5. Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more.
   
   *会倾听是一种超能力。当聆听某个喜欢的人时，善于询问“还有吗”，直到对方没有更多要讲。*

6. A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.
   
   *有一件有意义的年度目标是充分的去学习一个课题，你将会对自己一年前的无知感到难以置信。*

7. Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.
   
   *感恩可以使你解锁其它美德，还是一件你可以做到更好的事情。*

8. Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
   
   *请别人吃饭是不会被拒绝的，而且也很容易就可以做。无论对待老朋友还是新朋友都很有效。*

9. Don’t trust all-purpose glue.
   
   *不要相信万能胶（这里的万能胶应该类似于中文环境的万金油）*

10. Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations.
    
    *定期为你的孩子朗读书籍，有利于你们的关系并且激发他们的想象力。*

11. Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don’t be in debt to losers.
    
    *永远不要使用信用卡信贷。唯一可以接受的信贷或债务，是那些用来获取极有可能增值的事物，比如一栋房子。大部分事物在你买下它那一刻就贬值了。别为那些废物而负债。（我不确定“like in a home”是不是指房子，救命...）*

12. Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.
    
    *高手就是那些懂得优雅地在错误中成长的菜鸟。*

13. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.
    
    *非比寻常的观点需要非比寻常的证据以使人们信服。*

14. Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.
    
    *不要成为屋子里最聪明的那个人。去和那些比你聪明的人呆在一起，并向他们学习。甚至最好能够找到那些和你意见不同的聪明人。*

15. Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.
    
    *交谈的”3次原则“。想要得到真相，深入去询问某人刚说过的话。一遍再一遍。得到的第三次回答就很接近真相了。*

16. Don’t be the best. Be the only.
    
    *别成为最优质的，而是最稀缺的。*

17. Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
    
    *大家都很羞涩的。别人在等着你介绍自己，等你发邮件给他们，等你和他们约会。勇敢地上吧。*

18. Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.
    
    *不要太在意别人拒绝了你。假设对方像你一样忙碌，被事情缠绕，没有精力。过段时间再试试。第二次尝试的结果往往令人惊喜。（不会消息了吗hhh）*

19. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.
    
    *习惯的作用在于降低决策成本。你不需要再花费精力思考要不要做某件事。做就行了。好习惯包括讲真话，用牙线。*

20. Promptness is a sign of respect.
    
    *迅速回应是尊重的一种标志。*

21. When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario.
    
    *在年轻时花6个月到1年时间过你能接受最穷的生活，只使用最少的物品，住在迷你房子或帐篷里吃豆子或大米，去体验对你来说最“糟糕”的生活。这样，当你在未来被置于风险中时，你不会为最坏的可能担惊受怕。*

22. Trust me: There is no “them”.
    
    *相信我：这世上没有“他们”。（啥意思啊...）*

23. The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
    
    *你对别人越感兴趣，别人对你越感兴趣。想要自己变得有趣，先对外界感兴趣。*

24. Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.
    
    *慷慨一些。没人会在死前懊悔自己给予他人太多。*

25. To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.
    
    *想把什么事情做好，就去做它。想把什么事情做的更好，就再去做它，一遍遍重复。把事情做好的秘诀在于反复去做。*

26. The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.
    
    *黄金法则永远不会让你失望，它是其它美德的基础。*
    
    ::: tip
    Golden Rule的意思可能是：己所不欲，勿施于人。
    
    :::

27. If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.
    
    *如果你在家寻找什么东西，最后终于找到了，当你使用完它时，不要把它放回你发现它的地方。把它放在你最开始寻找的地方。*

28. Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
    
    *存钱与投资是好习惯。年复一年地无脑进行小额投资是一条致富的路。*

29. To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
    
    *人总是会犯错，接纳自己的错误是可贵的。快速承认并承担自己的责任然后尽力弥补，会使你成为更好的人。如果你搞砸了，就去承担。这会让你看起来非常强大。*

30. Never get involved in a land war in Asia.
    
    *永远不要卷入亚洲陆地战争。（land war是陆地战争还是土地之争呀？救救菜鸡）*

31. You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.
    
    *你可以专注服务你的顾客/听众/用户，你也可以专注于打败竞争对手。它们可行的，但两者相比较而言，把注意力放在顾客身上更有未来。*

32. Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.
    
    *在场，保持在场。某个成功的人说过：99%的成功仅仅是因为在场。*

33. Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.
    
    *将创造与改进剥离。你不能同时写作并编辑，雕刻并打磨，制造并分析。如果你这么做，完善心会打断创意力。当你发明时，不要想着现有的东西。当你雕刻时，不要同时打磨。当你写初稿时，不要反思。在一件事开始时，不要评判，而是最大程度释放创意。*

34. If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.
    
    *如果你从来没有失利过，那你肯定是在划水。（哈哈哈，coasting是划水吧，文化共通耶）*

35. Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.
    
    *或许宇宙中最反直觉的事情是你给予他人的越多，你将会得到的越多。明白了这个就是智慧的起点。*

36. Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.
    
    *朋友比钱好使。很多时候钱可以解决的问题，朋友可以做的更好。很多时候拥有一个有船的朋友好过拥一艘船。*

37. This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man.
    
    *一条真理：诚实的人很难被欺骗。*

38. When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you’ll find it.
    
    *当你找不到什么东西时，95%的情况是它就在你上次看到位置的一臂范围之内。仔细搜寻那个半径范围，你就能找到它。*

39. You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
    
    *你的所作所为成就了你。不是你所说过的，不是你所相信的，不是你所支持的，而是你把时间花在了什么地方。*

40. If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it.
    
    *如果你丢了或者落下了数据线、适配器或者充电器，可以去问问你的酒店。大部分酒店都有满满一抽屉的别人拉下的电源线、适配器、充电器，也许里面就有你丢的。你通常可以借走后把它据为己有。*

41. Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.
    
    *仇恨是一种诅咒，却对被仇恨者没什么影像。他只毒害仇恨者。把怨恨当毒物一样丢掉吧。*

42. There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with.
    
    *没有最好，只有很更好。天赋有高有低，但提升自己这件事没有上限。*

43. Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.
    
    *准备好：当你将一个大项目（一个房子、一部电影、一次大型活动、一个app）完成90%的时候，处理剩余的大量细节将会占用相同的时间。*

44. When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.
    
    *当你挂了的时候，除了名声掉你什么也带不走。*

45. Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
    
    *趁年轻，尽量多参加葬礼，去倾听。没人会谈论死者的成就。人们唯一记住的时当你获得成就时，你是个什么样的人。（相对于你有什么，人们只在意你给了他什么，所以有钱就要做慈善？）*

46. For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its life.
    
    *你在购买实体商品时每花费一块钱，将来都得花费相同的钱来维修，保养，或在报废后处理它。*

47. Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.
    
    *任何真实都源自于虚构。想象力是宇宙中最强大的力量，也是你可以加以锻炼的能力。这是人生中的一种技能，让你通过忽略已有知识而受益。（翻译的怪怪的...）*

48. When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
    
    *当危机和灾祸到来时，别浪费这次机会。没有问题就没有成长。*

49. On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first, bypassing the cities. You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in the remote, and then later you’ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back.
    
    *在旅行时把最偏远的地方当作第一站，先越过城市。你将会最大程度感受到远方异域的冲击，在返回的路上，你可以再享受城市所带来的熟悉的舒适感。*

50. When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
    
    *当你被邀请在未来参与某事时，先问自己：如果明天这事明天就要开始，你还会答应吗？大部分邀请是无法通过这种“即刻性过滤。”*

51. Don’t say anything about someone in email you would not be comfortable saying to them directly, because eventually they *will* read it.
    
    *不要在邮件里对他人评头论足，如果你并不想当面对他讲，因为最后他们总会读到你写的。*

52. If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss.
    
    *如果你很迫切需要一份工作，你不过是老板的另一个问题。如果你能解决老板面临的很多问题，那就会被聘用。想要被聘用，站在老板的立场思考。*

53. Art is in what you leave out.
    
    *艺术在你所忽视的地方。*

54. Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will.
    
    *拥有物品很少会带给你满足感，但拥有体验可以。*

55. Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer.
    
    *”7次调研“原则。如果你遵循”7次原则“，你总会获得答案。如果你问的第一个人不知道，问清楚还可以问谁，然后接着这么做。如果你愿意重复7次，你几乎总能得到想要的答案。*

56. How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.
    
    *如何道歉：快速，具体，真诚。*

57. Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
    
    *不要在电话中答应对方的请求或提议。着急都是假的。*

58. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.
    
    *当一个人在你面前表现得令人厌恶，粗鲁，可憎，刻薄时，设想他有病。这将使你更容易对对方产生同情，从而缓解冲突。*

59. Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.
    
    *清理垃圾，为真正重要的事物留出空间。*

60. You really don’t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person.
    
    你不会想出名的。不信可以随便找本名人传记读一读。

61. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
    
    经验被高估了。招聘时，去招有资质的，再去培养技能。很多令人惊奇或伟大的作品出自第一次做的人。

62. A vacation + a disaster = an adventure.
    
    假期 + 灾难 = 冒险。

63. Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
    
    *买工具的技巧：开始时买你能找到的最便宜的工具。升级那些你用起来频率高的。如果一些工具是用来工作的，买你能接受的最好的。（wind up怎么翻译？）*

64. Learn how to take a 20-minute power nap without embarrassment.
    
    *学会不尴尬地打盹20分钟。*

• Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.

• I’m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today.

• Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems.

• The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia.

For my 69th birthday I made another batch of [additional unsolicited advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).

I made a video recording of me reciting these 68 bits of advice from a rocking chair, [here](https://youtu.be/Zz70rcguxwk).
